    <title>Reading Reflection: The Rising Risk, and How We Stop It </title>
  </head>

    <p>
In this article, ”The Rising Risk, and How We Stop It,“ the author primarily aims to inform us that the risk of nuclear war is 
increasing globally. Although we go to class, work, and play every day, making nuclear weapons seem distant, the article is quite 
realistic, this danger is ever-present and closer than we realize. The article mentions that many major powers are upgrading 
their nuclear arsenals, some international cooperation agreements have been cancelled, and recent events such as the Ukraine war 
and the Middle East conflict have further destabilized the world, increasing the likelihood of nuclear weapons being used.
After reading this, I realized that our generation actually feels almost nothing about nuclear weapons. I haven’t experienced 
it myself, and I don’t fear war like the previous generation, such as my great-grandmother. So when we see the news, we probably 
just scroll past it. But the article reminded me that this isn’t something far away from me, if a nuclear conflict were to break 
out, it would affect the entire world. I feel this article is also telling our generation that while the information age makes 
it easy for us to access information, it also makes us more likely to overlook truly important content. We spend a lot of time 
on TikTok and Instagram, but the risks that could truly change the world might just remain in the corner of the news. Without
articles like this, we would never realize how important these issues are.
